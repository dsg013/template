                            Cryptocurrency mining is an energy-intensive process
                            used to keep blockchain networks like Bitcoin and
                            Ethereum running smoothly. The technical term for
                            this process is proof-of-work (PoW). PoW uses
                            computing power to add blocks to the blockchain and
                            process transactions.

                            PoW depends on miners to create and add the blocks.
                            For contributing to the PoW process, miners are
                            rewarded in crypto, which they can then
                            theoretically sell for a profit.

                            All you need to participate in mining is electricity
                            and a computer, however, there’s a catch. If your
                            electricity costs are higher than the value of your
                            crypto rewards, you end up losing money. And with
                            energy bills skyrocketing, turning a profit from
                            mining is becoming increasingly difficult.

                            charge, with $10-15 covering a full charge which can
                            power the Model 3 for around 300 miles.
